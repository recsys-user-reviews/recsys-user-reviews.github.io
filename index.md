**tldr:** We are trying to build a recommendation system using deep learning on amazon user reviews dataset!

## Why Recommendation Systems?
They are ubiquitous. Online retailers like Amazon, social media sites like Reddit, Instagram, and content discovery platforms like Google News depend on recommendation systems to provide personalized suggestions to their users. For instance, Amazon uses recommendation systems to suggest products based on a user's past purchases, searches, or even products viewed by other users with similar preferences.

These systems help businesses handle the information overload that users face, presenting them with the most relevant and personalized content or products. As catalogs expand on platforms, it becomes increasingly challenging for users to make informed choices without assistance. Recommendation systems solve this by tailoring options, making it easier to discover what they may like or need.

Our goal is to harness deep learning techniques, which have shown great potential in recommendation systems by capturing complex patterns in user behavior and product features. With Amazonâ€™s user reviews dataset, we can better understand customer sentiments and improve the recommendation accuracy, offering a more refined and personalized experience for every user.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
